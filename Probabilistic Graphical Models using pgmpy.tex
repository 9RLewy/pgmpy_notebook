    \subsubsection{Machine Learning}\label{machine-learning}

Machine learning is a scientific discipline that explores the
construction and study of algorithms that can learn from data. Such
algorithms operate by building a model from example inputs and using
that to make predictions or decisions, rather than following strictly
static program instructions. We will be considering only classification
here.

There are multiple ways to solve this problem:\\1. We could find a
function which can directly map an input value to it's class label. 2.
We can find the probability distributions over the variables and then
use this distribution to answer queries about the new data point.

In Probabilistic Graphical Models we try to do predictions using the
second method. The most obvious way to do this would be to compute a
Joint Probability Distribution over all these variables and then
marginalize and reduce over these according to our new data point to get
the probabilities of classes.

    Let's take an example of class where we want to predict things about
students. So, we have some previous data of students and for each
student we have 5 features: Difficulty (D), Intelligence (I), SAT (S),
Grade (G) and Recommendation Letter (L). For simplicity, we will also
consider that each of these features can have only two values. So,
difficulty can take two values easy and hard, Intelligence can take
smart and dumb and so on.

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
{\color{incolor}In [{\color{incolor}1}]:} \PY{c}{\PYZsh{} Let\PYZsq{}s now generate some random data. }
        \PY{c}{\PYZsh{} Now let\PYZsq{}s try to compute the Joint Probability Distribution over these variables.}
\end{Verbatim}

    We now have a Joint Distribution \$ P(D, I, S, G, L)
$. Now let's say we have a new student and we want to predict what recommendation letter will he get and also say that we know that he is intelligent, the course was easy, his SAT score is good, and also he got a good grade. So, basically we want to compute $
P(L \textbar{} d\^{}0, i\^{}1, s\^{}1, g\^{}1)
$. From chain rule of probability we know that: $ P(D, I, S, G, L) = P(L
\textbar{} D, I, S, G) * P(D, I, S, G) \$ \$ P(D, I, S, G, L) = P(D
\textbar{} I, S, G, L) * P(I \textbar{} S, G, L) * P(S \textbar{} G, L)
* P(G \textbar{} L) * P(L) \$ \$ P(L \textbar{} d\^{}0, i\^{}0, s\^{}1,
g\^{}1) = \frac {P(d^0, i^1, s^1, g^1, L)} \{P(d\^{}0, i\^{}1, s\^{}1,
g\^{}1)\} \$

Since we know the joint distribution, \$ P(D, I, S, G, L) \$ we can now
easily compute both the terms \$ P(d\^{}0, i\^{}1, s\^{}1, g\^{}1, L) \$
and \$ P(d\^{}0, i\^{}1, s\^{}1, g\^{}1) \$ and using these we will be
able to compute the \$ P(L \textbar{} d\^{}0, i\^{}0, s\^{}1, g\^{}1)
\$.

\paragraph{TODO: Show the computed
values}\label{todo-show-the-computed-values}

    The way we solved the problem above we had to compute the whole joint
distribution to answer queries over this model. And we can see that the
size of the table is exponential to the number of variables involved.
So, in the case of large models this method becomes infeasible.

    \subsubsection{Probabilistic Graphical Models
(PGM)}\label{probabilistic-graphical-models-pgm}

Probabilistic Graphical Model is a way of compactly representing Joint
Probability distribution over random variables by exploiting the
independence conditions of the variables. And PGM also provides us
methods to easly and efficiently compute conditional probabilities over
joint distributions.

    \subsubsection{How is PGM different than other
techniques?}\label{how-is-pgm-different-than-other-techniques}

The distinctive thing about PGM is that it provides a very intuitive and
natural approach for modelling complex problems along with maintaining
control over the computational costs.

    There are two main types of modes in PGM: 1. Bayesian Models: Bayesian
Models are used mainly when we have causal relationship between the
variables 2. Markov Models: When non causal relationship.

    In the student example that we saw, we mostly have a causal relationship
between variables. So, if a student is intelligent it implies that he
should get good grades, getting good grades implies that he will get a
better recommendation. Let's try to create a graph of dependencies.

    

    We used our intuition on mostly local parts of the network but using the
properties of Bayesian Networks we can also see global independencies.
Connections between variables in a directed graph can only be the
following four ways:

    

    In the case of causal, evidential and common cause connections A and C
are dependent if B is not observed but if B is observed then the become
independent. Whereas in the case of common evidence A and C are
independent if B is not observed but become dependent if B is observed.

So in the case of our student example we can now get many dependence
assertions over the network like \$ L \perp D \textbar{} G $, $ L
\perp I \textbar{} G $, $ D \perp I $, $ D \not\perp I \textbar{} G \$
etc.

    Now coming back to our original joint distribution distribution:
\[ P(D, I, G, S, R) = P(D | I, G, S, R) * P(I | G, S, R) * P(G | S, R) * P(S | R) * P(R) \]

So using these independence properties in a Bayesian Network we can
reduce this to:
\[ P(D, I, G, S, R) = P(D) * P(I) * P(G | D, I) * P(S | I) * P(L | G) \]

And we can also notice that all the terms in this are the probabilites
of each the variables given their parents in the network. These terms
are known as the conditional Probability distributions of the variables.
So basically to compute the Joint Distribuiton we can compute the
product of CPDs of all the variables.

    \subsubsection{Another example using
pgmpy}\label{another-example-using-pgmpy}

Let's see an example for predicting the price of a house. For simplicity
we will consider that the price of the house depends only on Area,
Location, Furnishing, Crime Rate and Distance from the airport. And also
we will consider that all of these are discrete variables.

    Our raw data would look something like this:

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
{\color{incolor}In [{\color{incolor}3}]:} \PY{k+kn}{import} \PY{n+nn}{numpy} \PY{k+kn}{as} \PY{n+nn}{np}

        \PY{k}{print}\PY{p}{(}\PY{n}{raw\PYZus{}data}\PY{p}{)}
\end{Verbatim}

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
[[0 0 0 1 1 0]
 [0 0 0 0 1 0]
 [1 1 1 0 0 0]
 \ldots, 
 [1 1 0 1 1 0]
 [0 1 0 1 0 1]
 [1 1 1 0 0 1]]
    \end{Verbatim}

    Probabilistic Graphical Models keeps the representation of Joint
Distribution simple by exploiting the dependencies in the variables. And
these dependencies are represented using a graph. Now let's create a
model for the interaction of our variables using intuition:

    

    

    For each node/variable in the network we assign a conditional
probability distribution to it. The conditional probability distribution
represents the probability of the variable when its parents are
observed. So now using our raw data let's assign CPDs to each of these
nodes.

    \subsubsection{What does fit does ?}\label{what-does-fit-does}

The fit method adds a Conditional Probability Distribution (CPD) to each
of the node in our model

    But the data that we have for training might be baised so with pgmpy we
also have the option to assign your own Conditional Probability
Distributions. Let's say the probability of getting an unfurnished home
is equal to getting a furnished house. Let's adjust the values according
to this.

    True

    \subsubsection{Inference}\label{inference}

    Now let's try to do some reasoning on our model to verify if our
intuitution for the model was correct or not.

\end{Verbatim}

    \begin{verbatim}
P          phi(A)  
------------------
P_0        0.96
P_1        0.04
\end{verbatim}

    If you think about prediction about new values from this model, it is
basically the same what we have been doing here. We basically ask
questions about the probability of some variable giving conditions for
other variables. Also we can account for missing values with just
leaving it blank.
